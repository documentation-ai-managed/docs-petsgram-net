## Feature Your Pet

To get your pet's post featured on Petsgram's main page:

1. Create a new post with a photo or video of your pet.
2. Add the hashtag **#petsgramfeature** to your post description.
3. Make sure your profile is set to public so others can see your post.
4. Only one featured post per user per week is allowed.

Our team reviews posts with #petsgramfeature and selects highlights for the main page.
